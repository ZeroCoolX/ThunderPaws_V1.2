# ThunderPaws


### Long ago the planet Catana fell into an inescapable war with their nemisis counterpart, the *Mausues*. The conflict almost descimated the entire feline race had it not been for the creation of an elite task force of super feline badasses known only as the *ThunderPaws* who triumphed over the vermin and destroyed all but 4 of the rodents who managed to escape into the recesses of space. 
### For 10 years the planet Catana and their fuzzy inhabitants knew only of laying on the public windowsills and basking in the sun. However far above on an abandoned satellite the 4 escaped rodents swore revenge on Catana and banded together to create the *Mausu Gang*. Over the years they began using left over technology on the space station to construct a robot army that could lead them to settle the score with their feline adversaries. 
### 10 years later the planet Catana is suddenly attacked by the remnant gang of mechanized space mice and their robot horde seeking revenge on the feline planet! The furry inhabitants must once again call upon the *Thunderpaws* who saved them from the clutches of verminosity 10 years ago. The leaders of the Thunderpaws Barney, and Rupert have been waiting for this day. Waiting to catch the red dot of fate. Waiting to tear at the scratchpost of destiny. Ready to kick ass and chew catnip...And they're all out of catnip.
