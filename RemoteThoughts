* Idea for one of the bosses : (Similar to first boss in Nier)
  Head and two hands. Hands shoot out the projectiles - you have to blow up each hand for the head to become vulnerable
  Then the head needs to be destroyed as it is also tryingto kill you.
  1/3 health for each hand and the head.

* Idea for weapon (Particle beam, Molecule Rearranger, Gene ripper, Idk on a name just yet).
Inspiration is that of the Spartan Lazer from halo.
Lazor that charges up. Has something like a 0.5s charge rate and then fires a massive (as tall as the player) lazor straight in 
whatever direction the player was aiming at fire time.
The lazor deals massive damage. Also the lazor shoots out a max distance of 2/3 of the way to the opposite side of the screen 
OR whatever environment obstacle it comes in contact with.
